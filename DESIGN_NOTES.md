# Evergreen Library Fire Alarm System Design Notes

## Overview
This document details the design considerations for the fire alarm system at Evergreen Library.

## High Value Asset Protection
Special considerations for protecting high-value areas such as the rare book archives.

### Standard Photoelectric Coverage
The rare book archive is currently protected by three photoelectric smoke detectors (SMOKE-101, SMOKE-102, SMOKE-103) providing overlapping coverage. These detectors are adequate for typical smoke detection but may not provide the earliest possible warning for incipient fires.

## System Layout
The system uses a single SLC loop with multiple notification appliance circuits.

## Power Calculations
Battery backup sufficient for 24 hours of standby and 5 minutes of alarm.
