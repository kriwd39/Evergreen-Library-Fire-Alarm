# Evergreen Library Fire Alarm System Design Notes

## Overview
This document details the design considerations for the fire alarm system at Evergreen Library.

## High Value Asset Protection
Special considerations for protecting high-value areas such as the rare book archives.

### Aspirating Smoke Detection (ASD) System
The rare book archive will now be protected by a highly sensitive aspirating smoke detection (ASD) system. This system continuously draws air samples through a network of pipes to a central detector, providing extremely early warning of incipient fires before they become visible. This enhanced detection is critical for protecting irreplaceable historical documents.

## System Layout
The system uses a single SLC loop with multiple notification appliance circuits.

## Power Calculations
Battery backup sufficient for 24 hours of standby and 5 minutes of alarm.
